# 2048 Game
2048 is a popular single-player sliding block puzzle game. The objective of the game is to slide numbered tiles on a grid to combine them and create a tile with the number 2048.

The game starts with two tiles of either 2 or 4 randomly placed on the grid. The player can move the tiles in any of the four directions: up, down, left, or right. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into a single tile with the sum of their numbers. After each move, a new tile appears randomly on the grid with a value of either 2 or 4. The game is won when a tile with the number 2048 is created, and the game is lost when there are no more moves available.
